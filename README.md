#### JavaScript: Object Oriented Programming

Today, I worked through the JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures section, specifically the Object Oriented Programming course.

An **Object** class is one of several data types in JavaScript. Objects are used to store data in the form of *Properties* and *Values*. Within an object, you can create several Properties and also assign values to those properties.

For example:

```
let dog = {
    name: "Xena",
    color: "black",
    numLegs: 4
};
```

In the above code, we are creating an object called **dog**. The object **dog** has three properties, *name*, *color* and *numLegs* and each property is assigned a value.
